1. Use modern libraries like `gtk4-layer-shell`.  
2. The bar must be pixel-perfect and responsive. No hardcoded x/y positions unless unavoidable â€” use anchors.  
3. All layout and styling is defined in CSS, not YAML or code.  
4. Changes (workspaces, titles, clock, etc.) must not shift or break other components. Layout remains stable.  
5. When a monitor connects/disconnects or resolution changes, the bar reprocesses and updates seamlessly.  
6. All UI should be accessible: adequate contrast, readable font sizes, no clipping or overlap.  
7. Animations or transitions must be defined in CSS only. Never hardcode animations in Rust.  
8. add relevant class/id tags to every ui element rendered - per monitor/bar, per column, per module. The idea is that i can apply a style specifically to say the clock module in the left-of-center section on monitor DP-3 but not others.
