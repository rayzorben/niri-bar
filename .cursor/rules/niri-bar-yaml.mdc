- Define global module defaults once, and reuse everywhere.
- Support reusable named layouts that describe column â†’ modules mapping.
- Allow arbitrary column names (renderer uses column count/order, not names).
- Per-monitor configs can override layout choice and module settings.
- Keep configs DRY: use YAML merge/inheritance for overrides instead of duplication.
- Config options always have safe, minimal defaults. Never surprise the user.  
- Config must validate against a JSON Schema before use. Invalid config = error + log message.  
- Config changes should be hot-reloadable without restarting the bar whenever possible.  
- Should be validated against src/niri-bar-yaml.schema.json and this schema should be updated if yaml is changed.
- As part of unit testing, schema validation should always be done fixed if it doesn't validate.
- NEVER test against the yaml itself as it can change
- ONLY validate the yaml against the schema
