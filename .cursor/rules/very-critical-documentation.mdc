- be excessive in comments but not per line, in goals, methodology
- README.md should be USER specific on how to configure and run this
- create a new wiki/ folder with documentation on the actual project, apis, goals, decisions, how it works, etc.
- at the top of README.md lets detail how this is a Cursor AI based project and the author doesn't know rust, although he has a wide background in C, C++, Pascal, Perl, Python, Javascript, C#, and X++. The goal of this project is to use Rust but not write a single line of code.
